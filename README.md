## ðŸ“¦ Progress

[//]: # (Since I'm a complete novice when it comes to rust the more advanced implementations have stumped me, and I've only been able to do the very simple ones.)

Since I'm basically a complete novice when it comes to rust, I'd like to see if some people with a little more rust expertise could help out.

[Pull Requests](/pulls) are very appreciated, make sure to join the Discord Server to discuss!
